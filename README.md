# :tada: Architecture

In the folder architecture was oriented by features by layers. Where:

Core: it's the app configs, as Api Client and Routes.
Shared: It's the global and shared files, as state_notifiers, repositories and widgets.
Features: It's the feat config, as home and purchase where each feature has you own layers.

```
