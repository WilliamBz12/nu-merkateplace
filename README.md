# :tada: Architecture

In the folder architecture was oriented by features by layers. Where:

- Core: it's the app configs, as Api Client and Routes.
- Shared: It's the global and shared files, as state_notifiers, repositories and widgets.
- Features: It's the feat config, as home and purchase where each feature has you own layers.

```
app/
  features/
  |- home
  |- purchase
    |- repositories
    |- state_notifiers
    |- widgets
    |- pages
    purchase_provider.dart
  core/
    |- routes
    |- api
      api_client_factory.dart #As API provider
  shared/
    |- repositories
    |- state_notifiers
    |-widgets #common widgets

app_provider.dart
```

# :closed_book: Why Riverpod with State Notifier?

I was decide use Riverpod 'cause some reasons, the main was:
- The provider is build in a simple var out of the widget file and can be used in any widget.
- Authored by RÃ©mi Rousselet, the creator of provider (it's to be better than provider package)
- AutoDispose, when you use auto dispose in your dependecy, it's will be disposed when has no watch in the var, so we have gain of memory.

I was decide use State Notifier for the following reasons: 
- imumutable, as bloc. 
- state field is a single Stream of State like bloc cubit, so it's not complicate to use.
- It's make to use with Riverpod.
